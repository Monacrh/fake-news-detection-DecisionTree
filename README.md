# Fake News Detection Using Python & Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Fake News Detection** system using **Python** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The model is trained to classify news articles as either real or fake, helping to identify and combat misinformation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:
[Indonesia False News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadghazimuharam/indonesiafalsenews/data)

The dataset contains a collection of news articles in Bahasa Indonesia, labeled to distinguish between real and fake news.

## Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used:** Decision Tree Classifier
- The Decision Tree algorithm is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, making it easier to understand the model's decisions.

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Libraries:
  - Streamlit
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK

## Results
The Decision Tree classifier achieved satisfactory accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its capability to identify fake news effectively.
