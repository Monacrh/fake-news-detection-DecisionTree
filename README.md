Fake News Detection Using Python & Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Fake News Detection system using Python and Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained to classify news articles as either real or fake, helping to identify and combat misinformation.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:
Indonesia False News Dataset

The dataset contains a collection of news articles in Bahasa Indonesia, labeled to distinguish between real and fake news.

Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier

The Decision Tree algorithm is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, making it easier to understand the model's decisions.
